# Impact-Of-Data-Mining-On-OTT-Platforms.
I wrote this paper back in my freshman year along with my teammates @mahir2237 and @pranjali1312. We analysed the role of data mining in the rise of OTT platforms. It is a short but extremely informative read.

Abstract
The recent times have witnessed a major turn around in the 
entertainment industry. Traditional television systems are slowly losing 
viewership, while online streaming platforms are booming. There have 
been large scale movements in show businesses, advertisement 
industries, content genres, etc. Various forms of data analysis have been 
widely used for predictive analysis and for advertisements. Over the 
course of this paper, we have made an attempt at understanding the 
performance and significance of data mining techniques in the modern 
day show business
